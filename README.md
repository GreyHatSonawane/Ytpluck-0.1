# 🎵 YTPLUCK 0.1

**YTPLUCK** is a lightweight, GUI-based YouTube playlist downloader built in Python. It started as a simple command-line tool that could fetch and convert entire YouTube playlists into MP3 files — but evolved into a polished, cross-platform desktop app.

## 📖 The Story of YTPLUCK

**YTPLUCK** started off as a simple CLI music downloader. I wanted a way to drop in a playlist URL and automatically download every track as an MP3. That prototype worked great — but it was time to make it visual and more user-friendly.

So I built **YTPLUCK 0.1**, featuring:
- ✅ GUI built with PyQt6
- 🎵 Full playlist MP3 downloader
- 🖼️ Embedded thumbnails and metadata
- 📂 Auto-creation of a downloads folder
- 💻 Cross-platform (Windows + Linux supported)
- 📦 Built-in FFmpeg integration
- 🎯 Simple workflow: paste playlist → get clean MP3 files

> This is a **non-maintained open-source project for now** — but if it gets noticed or forked, future versions might follow.
